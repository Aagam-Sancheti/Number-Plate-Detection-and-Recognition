# Number-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition
Number Plate Recognition using Haar Cascade and EasyOCR  This project is a Python-based Number Plate Recognition system that uses OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade classifier to detect vehicles and extract number plates from a video or a live camera feed. The extracted number plate is then processed using EasyOCR to recognize and read the characters.
